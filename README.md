# SharperUniverse

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RubyNova/SharperUniverse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RubyNova/SharperUniverse)

A custom text-controlled adventure/text-controlled RPG/MUD engine for .NET so straightforward that even a monkey could use it.

## About

SharperUniverse is a genre-agnostic text-based game engine primarily meant for text-based adventures, RPGs and MUDs - but it's agnostic, so it can be used for any genre!

The engine is being designed to be a scalable, powerful solution for both single-player and multiplayer-based games, while also being a solid introduction for those new to games development to many of the common practices used in the industry. Some of the features include:

* Asynchronous ECS with game loop for accurate real time-based gameplay.
* Can act as both the platform for a standalone game or a game server for clients to connect to.
* Telnet protocol support to attach to allow existing MUD clients to connect.
* Flexibility with custom endpoints for networking behaviour.
* Capability to add real time-based game AI.
* My really bad memes if stuff goes wrong in ways that should be physically impossible, in which case, thanks for breaking my engine but can you please stop hurting my baby?
